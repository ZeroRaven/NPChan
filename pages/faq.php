	<!-- Boards -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="board">
		<h3>Boards</h3>
		<p>Consider board as a (facebook) group where anyone can add new posts according to the theme/category of the board. For example, a board "<a href="/g/">Technology</a>" consists of everything related to technology (hardware and software) and a board "<a href="/lit/">Literature</a>" consists of everything related to literature.</p>
		<p>Each board have their own unique link. These link are found on address bar as: <code>http://npchan.com/{LINK}/</code>.
			For example, "Technology" board's link is <b>/g/</b> and "Literature" board's link is <b>/lit/</b>.</p>
		<p>You can create a link to any board using following syntax on any <a href="#thread">thread</a> or <a href="#reply">thread reply</a>: <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;/{link}/</code>. Example: <b><a href="/lit/">&gt;&gt;&gt;/lit/</a></b>. (<a href="#formatting">Learn more</a>)</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Threads -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="thread">
		<h3>Threads</h3>
		<p>Thread is a post created within a board. Every thread starts a new topic to discuss on. A thread can be started with an image or a text or both.</p>
		<p>Creating a thread is as easy as posting "feeling sick" on your fav. social media. On the top of the boards page, there is a form where you can type what you want to say or upload an image.</p>
		<p>Either text or an image is required to create a new thread. Subject for a thread is optional.</p>
		<p>Please make thread sensibly. Avoid duplicate thread and respect the board rules.</p>
		<p>Every thread can have many replies within like comment on posts at your fav. social media.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Reply -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="reply">
		<h3>Reply</h3>
		<p>Reply or comment is what you respond on a thread. There are no "like", "react" or "upvote" thing on NPChan. Thread is the only way to respond. Reply, like threads, can be created either with image or a text or both.</p>
		<p>You can add new reply to the thread using the form at top of the thread's detail page or by using quick reply button.</p>
		<p><b>Quick Reply</b> is the easy way to reply to a post. However, quick reply may not be usable on mobile devices as it requires Javascript. Quick Reply posts your reply without reloading the page.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Imageboard -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="imageboard">
		<h3>Imageboard</h3>
		<p>Imageboard is a website where discussion are created with images and most of the reply are done using images (image macros to be exact) or using text. NPChan is a discussion board but isn't a pure imageboard as it doesn't require an image to start a new thread. Some popular imageboard existing currently are 4chan and 8chan and NPChan tries to be as much close as them in functionality while retaining its own uniqueness.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Anonymous -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="anonymous">
		<h3>Anonymous</h3>
		<p>Anonymous (anon, in short) means someone whose identity is not known. NPChan is an anonymous discussion board which implies, NPChan doesn't reveals your identity to anyone nor asks any of your personal information. Anonymous is the default name of every user in NPChan.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Account -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="account">
		<h3>Account (Login/Registration)</h3>
		<p>NPChan doesnot require an account for any purpose. This means, you do not have to create a new account to begin using NPChan. Just use the form on top of the page to create new thread or reply to one without providing any of your information.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Preview -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="preview">
		<h3>Image Preview</h3>
		<p>By default, NPChan shows a image posted in thread and reply in thumbnail (small size). To view the full image, you can click the image and it will enlarge the image on same position.</p>
		<p>Video Preview works with same mechanism but while closing the video, you have to click on <b>- Close Video</b> button.</p>
		<p>If your browser doesn't support javascript (on mobile or on old version of browser), you will be redirected to full image source.</p>
		<p>To minimize the image back to thumbnail size, click on that large image again.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Locked Thread -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="locked">
		<h3>Thread Locked</h3>
		<p>When a thread is locked, you cannot reply to that thread. This is often done to threads by <a href="#moderator">moderators</a> when the thread doesn't require any replies.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Pinned Thread -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="pinned">
		<h3>Pinned Thread</h3>
		<p>A pinned thread always shows at top of the boards page. This pinned thread generally is a detailed information, notice, announcement or rules of the specific board.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Thread Archived -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="archive">
		<h3>Thread Archived</h3>
		<p>A thread is archived when it is no longer active or has met its limit.</p>
		<p>Posts with few replies (less than 10) will not be archived.</p>
		<p>A thread gets archived if there is no activity for 12 hours on that thread.</p>
		<p>A thread if it reaches 250 replies will get archived. This is the maximum number of replies one thread can get.</p>
		<p>Low engagement thread gets <a href="#deleted">Deleted</a></p>
		<p>While a thread gets archived, all the information of user (IP Address, Browser Info) gets removed.</p>
		<p>Archive process is done automatically. <a href="#moderator">Moderators</a> cannot archive a page.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Thread Deleted -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="deleted">
		<h3>Thread Deleted</h3>
		<p>When a thead is no longer active for more than 12 hours (no replies) and has less than 10 replies, it will get deleted. If it has more than 10 replies, it will be <a href="#archive">Archived</a>.</p>
		<p>When a post gets deleted, we permanently delete all the contents within (including: replies, images, user information associated with thread).</p>
		<p>If you start a thread, you can <a href="#delete">delete</a> that thread permanently.</p>
		<p>If a thread is archived, you cannot delete it by yourself.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Thread Bump -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="bump">
		<h3>Thread "Bump"</h3>
		<p>Bump or "Bumping" is the process of boosting a thread. Every reply bumps a thread a little bit.</p>
		<p>Recently bumped thread appears first on the boards page and overboard.</p>
		<p>A thread can only be bumped once every minute (except for <b>random</b>(/b/) board, 30 seconds). Which means, even if you reply inbetween that interval, that thread will not be bumped.</p>
		<p><b>If you do not like the thread, do not reply to it as it will get bumped.</b></p>
	</div>



	<!-- Sage -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="sage">
		<h3>Sage</h3>
		<p>Sage is opposite of bump. A sage decreases the last bump time for one minute (30 sec for <b>random</b> (/b/) board) which causes the thread to get pushed back from top of the board.</p>
		<p><b>Only sage a thread only if you feel that thread shouldn't be on the board or is inappropriate. "Saging" a thread just because you don't agree to that person's opinion is against our rules, which may result in <a href="#ban">ban</a>.</b></p>
		<p>You can sage a thread by replying <b>sage</b> or <b>saged</b> on reply. Do not add any other text there else we can't determine if you saged a post or not (but you can upload an image on that sage reply).</p>
	</div>




	<!-- Spoilers -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="spoilers">
		<h3>Spoilers</h3>
		<p>A spoilers <spoil>(Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)ï»¿</spoil> is a text hidden from direct viewing if it contains literal spoilers, adult words or something everyone wants to see directly on a board.</p>
		<p>Just put a mouse over the <spoil>spoiler</spoil> to reveal the text.</p>
		<p>Spoiler are available on few boards only.</p>
		<p>Use <code>[s] TEXT HERE [/s]</code> to hide a text as spoiler.</p>
		<p>You can use <code>[spoiler] TEXT HERE TOO [/spoiler]</code> too.</p>
		<p>If you are using adult words outside NSFW boards, it is wise to use spoilers tag.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- NSFW -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="nsfw">
		<h3>NSFW</h3>
		<p>NSFW stands for "Not Suitable for Work" which means, that board/thread may contain adult images (like: pornography) or contains extremely adult language.</p>
		<p>These boards aren't meant for anyone lighthearted. If you are not brave enough or doesn't wish to see the adult content, please do not visit such board.</p>
		<p>If you do not wish to see such contents, even by mistake; Go to <a href="/settings/">settings</a> and click on <b>Hide NSFW</b> option.</p>
		<p>Changing the settings doesn't guarentee you will never see such contents, but will ensure that NPChan will do its best to hide such posts from you.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Quote -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="quote">
		<h3>Quote (Greentext)</h3>
		<p>Quote (also known as Greentext) is a way to quote someone's saying from their reply or just focus on something you want to highlighted.</p>

		<p>All links posted will be highlighted automatically (unless user disable the function via settings)</p>

		<h3>Never Asked Questions</h3>
	</div>


	<!-- Why is NPChan Made? Wasn't 4chan enough? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="yyy">
		<h3>Why was NPChan made? Wasn't 4chan enough?</h3>
		<p>NPChan was made for providing Nepalese people a easy and "Nepalese-friendly" shitposting website (i mean, a website where you can be free, where you can post literally anything you want as long as it is legal), basically another 4chan for Nepalese people.</p>
		<p>4chan wasn't enough. No one from Nepal will go to 4chan and even if they do, they will require a lot of time getting used to 4chan and its community. NPChan tries to a more user friendly way to use anonymous discussion board. Plus, NPChan is made for Nepalese people by Nepalese people. Do you even have that proub wala feeling?</p>
	</div>


	<!-- What is reddit then? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="reddit">
		<h3>What is reddit then?</h3>
		<p>reddit is not an anonymous discussion board. period.</p>
	</div>


	<!-- Why are you making this? Just get a job or do something productive. -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="why-do">
		<h3>Why are you making this? Just get a job or do something productive.</h3>
		<p>What do you expect me to do? Make a shitty news website and spread fake/clickbait news on every facebook group? I am doing something productive here! At least few people get post their naughty stuffs on NPChan without getting zucced!</p>
	</div>



	<!-- I am not convinced that NPChan isn't a botnet! What if you secretly collect our data? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="botnet">
		<h3>I am not convinced that NPChan isn't a botnet! What if you secretly collect our data?</h3>
		<p>lol. NPChan isn't a botnet. What am I gonna do with your data?</p>
		<p>NPChan is open source, check what data we collect and how we handle it!</p>
		<p><b>B-but, you can always alter the code while using on main site?</b> why would I do that? What's the benefit I achive? Your IP address worth nothing for me.</p>
		<p>Just a disclaimer; if you trust me with your IP Address, use NPChan freely. I am not going to tell anyone what you post. Plus, how will I know who you are. I just get your IP address.</p>
		<p>Another disclaimer; If you can't trust me, use any other alternative (good luck) :) </p>
	</div>


	<!-- Why go with the material design by default? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="material">
		<h3>Why go with the material design by default?</h3>
		<p>Material design is somehow provides "modern" look to the website and we don't want users to feel like they are using a website designed on 2003.</p>
		<p>If you don't like it, change the theme. We got few good themes like that 2003 one, a dark one and few more. It is just two clicks away (check the settings)!</p>
	</div>


	<!-- Why did you released the source code? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="sauce">
		<h3>Why did you released the source code?</h3>
		<p>Point 1: To build user's trust that NPChan is safe to use!</p>
		<p>Point 2: To let others help me since I am not a professional web developer and can't make a 4chan clone by myself.</p>

	<!-- Why can I create new thread without image? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="no-img">
		<h3>Why can I create new thread without an image?</h3>
		<p>1. It is cheap way since less images takes less server space and the most economic way for us.</p>
		<p>2. Why upload an image when you don't need one? Just post what you have to say and its fine for everyone.</p>

	<!-- Boards -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="board">
		<h3>Boards</h3>
		<p>Consider board as a (facebook) group where anyone can add new posts according to the theme/category of the board. For example, a board "<a href="/g/">Technology</a>" consists of everything related to technology (hardware and software) and a board "<a href="/lit/">Literature</a>" consists of everything related to literature.</p>
		<p>Each board have their own unique link. These link are found on address bar as: <code>http://npchan.com/{LINK}/</code>.
			For example, "Technology" board's link is <b>/g/</b> and "Literature" board's link is <b>/lit/</b>.</p>
		<p>You can create a link to any board using following syntax on any <a href="#thread">thread</a> or <a href="#reply">thread reply</a>: <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;/{link}/</code>. Example: <b><a href="/lit/">&gt;&gt;&gt;/lit/</a></b>. (<a href="#formatting">Learn more</a>)</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Threads -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="thread">
		<h3>Threads</h3>
		<p>Thread is a post created within a board. Every thread starts a new topic to discuss on. A thread can be started with an image or a text or both.</p>
		<p>Creating a thread is as easy as posting "feeling sick" on your fav. social media. On the top of the boards page, there is a form where you can type what you want to say or upload an image.</p>
		<p>Either text or an image is required to create a new thread. Subject for a thread is optional.</p>
		<p>Please make thread sensibly. Avoid duplicate thread and respect the board rules.</p>
		<p>Every thread can have many replies within like comment on posts at your fav. social media.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Reply -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="reply">
		<h3>Reply</h3>
		<p>Reply or comment is what you respond on a thread. There are no "like", "react" or "upvote" thing on NPChan. Thread is the only way to respond. Reply, like threads, can be created either with image or a text or both.</p>
		<p>You can add new reply to the thread using the form at top of the thread's detail page or by using quick reply button.</p>
		<p><b>Quick Reply</b> is the easy way to reply to a post. However, quick reply may not be usable on mobile devices as it requires Javascript. Quick Reply posts your reply without reloading the page.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Imageboard -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="imageboard">
		<h3>Imageboard</h3>
		<p>Imageboard is a website where discussion are created with images and most of the reply are done using images (image macros to be exact) or using text. NPChan is a discussion board but isn't a pure imageboard as it doesn't require an image to start a new thread. Some popular imageboard existing currently are 4chan and 8chan and NPChan tries to be as much close as them in functionality while retaining its own uniqueness.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Anonymous -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="anonymous">
		<h3>Anonymous</h3>
		<p>Anonymous (anon, in short) means someone whose identity is not known. NPChan is an anonymous discussion board which implies, NPChan doesn't reveals your identity to anyone nor asks any of your personal information. Anonymous is the default name of every user in NPChan.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Account -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="account">
		<h3>Account (Login/Registration)</h3>
		<p>NPChan doesnot require an account for any purpose. This means, you do not have to create a new account to begin using NPChan. Just use the form on top of the page to create new thread or reply to one without providing any of your information.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Preview -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="preview">
		<h3>Image Preview</h3>
		<p>By default, NPChan shows a image posted in thread and reply in thumbnail (small size). To view the full image, you can click the image and it will enlarge the image on same position.</p>
		<p>Video Preview works with same mechanism but while closing the video, you have to click on <b>- Close Video</b> button.</p>
		<p>If your browser doesn't support javascript (on mobile or on old version of browser), you will be redirected to full image source.</p>
		<p>To minimize the image back to thumbnail size, click on that large image again.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Locked Thread -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="locked">
		<h3>Thread Locked</h3>
		<p>When a thread is locked, you cannot reply to that thread. This is often done to threads by <a href="#moderator">moderators</a> when the thread doesn't require any replies.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Pinned Thread -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="pinned">
		<h3>Pinned Thread</h3>
		<p>A pinned thread always shows at top of the boards page. This pinned thread generally is a detailed information, notice, announcement or rules of the specific board.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Thread Archived -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="archive">
		<h3>Thread Archived</h3>
		<p>A thread is archived when it is no longer active or has met its limit.</p>
		<p>Posts with few replies (less than 10) will not be archived.</p>
		<p>A thread gets archived if there is no activity for 12 hours on that thread.</p>
		<p>A thread if it reaches 250 replies will get archived. This is the maximum number of replies one thread can get.</p>
		<p>Low engagement thread gets <a href="#deleted">Deleted</a></p>
		<p>While a thread gets archived, all the information of user (IP Address, Browser Info) gets removed.</p>
		<p>Archive process is done automatically. <a href="#moderator">Moderators</a> cannot archive a page.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Thread Deleted -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="deleted">
		<h3>Thread Deleted</h3>
		<p>When a thead is no longer active for more than 12 hours (no replies) and has less than 10 replies, it will get deleted. If it has more than 10 replies, it will be <a href="#archive">Archived</a>.</p>
		<p>When a post gets deleted, we permanently delete all the contents within (including: replies, images, user information associated with thread).</p>
		<p>If you start a thread, you can <a href="#delete">delete</a> that thread permanently.</p>
		<p>If a thread is archived, you cannot delete it by yourself.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Thread Bump -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="bump">
		<h3>Thread "Bump"</h3>
		<p>Bump or "Bumping" is the process of boosting a thread. Every reply bumps a thread a little bit.</p>
		<p>Recently bumped thread appears first on the boards page and overboard.</p>
		<p>A thread can only be bumped once every minute (except for <b>random</b>(/b/) board, 30 seconds). Which means, even if you reply inbetween that interval, that thread will not be bumped.</p>
		<p><b>If you do not like the thread, do not reply to it as it will get bumped.</b></p>
	</div>



	<!-- Sage -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="sage">
		<h3>Sage</h3>
		<p>Sage is opposite of bump. A sage decreases the last bump time for one minute (30 sec for <b>random</b> (/b/) board) which causes the thread to get pushed back from top of the board.</p>
		<p><b>Only sage a thread only if you feel that thread shouldn't be on the board or is inappropriate. "Saging" a thread just because you don't agree to that person's opinion is against our rules, which may result in <a href="#ban">ban</a>.</b></p>
		<p>You can sage a thread by replying <b>sage</b> or <b>saged</b> on reply. Do not add any other text there else we can't determine if you saged a post or not (but you can upload an image on that sage reply).</p>
	</div>




	<!-- Spoilers -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="spoilers">
		<h3>Spoilers</h3>
		<p>A spoilers <spoil>(Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)ï»¿</spoil> is a text hidden from direct viewing if it contains literal spoilers, adult words or something everyone wants to see directly on a board.</p>
		<p>Just put a mouse over the <spoil>spoiler</spoil> to reveal the text.</p>
		<p>Spoiler are available on few boards only.</p>
		<p>Use <code>[s] TEXT HERE [/s]</code> to hide a text as spoiler.</p>
		<p>You can use <code>[spoiler] TEXT HERE TOO [/spoiler]</code> too.</p>
		<p>If you are using adult words outside NSFW boards, it is wise to use spoilers tag.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- NSFW -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="nsfw">
		<h3>NSFW</h3>
		<p>NSFW stands for "Not Suitable for Work" which means, that board/thread may contain adult images (like: pornography) or contains extremely adult language.</p>
		<p>These boards aren't meant for anyone lighthearted. If you are not brave enough or doesn't wish to see the adult content, please do not visit such board.</p>
		<p>If you do not wish to see such contents, even by mistake; Go to <a href="/settings/">settings</a> and click on <b>Hide NSFW</b> option.</p>
		<p>Changing the settings doesn't guarentee you will never see such contents, but will ensure that NPChan will do its best to hide such posts from you.</p>
	</div>



	<!-- Quote -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="quote">
		<h3>Quote (Greentext)</h3>
		<p>Quote (also known as Greentext) is a way to quote someone's saying from their reply or just focus on something you want to highlighted.</p>

	<!-- Formatting -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="formatting">

		<h3>Never Asked Questions</h3>
	</div>


	<!-- Why is NPChan Made? Wasn't 4chan enough? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="yyy">
		<h3>Why was NPChan made? Wasn't 4chan enough?</h3>
		<p>NPChan was made for providing Nepalese people a easy and "Nepalese-friendly" shitposting website (i mean, a website where you can be free, where you can post literally anything you want as long as it is legal), basically another 4chan for Nepalese people.</p>
		<p>4chan wasn't enough. No one from Nepal will go to 4chan and even if they do, they will require a lot of time getting used to 4chan and its community. NPChan tries to a more user friendly way to use anonymous discussion board. Plus, NPChan is made for Nepalese people by Nepalese people. Do you even have that proub wala feeling?</p>
	</div>


	<!-- What is reddit then? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="reddit">
		<h3>What is reddit then?</h3>

		<h3>Why are you making this? Just get a job or do something productive.</h3>

	<div class="card-footer faq" id="botnet">
		<h3>I am not convinced that NPChan isn't a botnet! What if you secretly collect our data?</h3>
		<p>lol. NPChan isn't a botnet. What am I gonna do with your data?</p>
		<p>NPChan is open source, check what data we collect and how we handle it!</p>
		<p><b>B-but, you can always alter the code while using on main site?</b> why would I do that? What's the benefit I achive? Your IP address worth nothing for me.</p>
		<p>Just a disclaimer; if you trust me with your IP Address, use NPChan freely. I am not going to tell anyone what you post. Plus, how will I know who you are. I just get your IP address.</p>
		<p>Another disclaimer; If you can't trust me, use any other alternative (good luck) :) </p>
	</div>


	<!-- Why go with the material design by default? -->
	<div class="card-footer faq" id="material">
